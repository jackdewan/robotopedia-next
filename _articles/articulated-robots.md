Articulated robots have become an essential part of modern industry, and it's easy to see why! These versatile and flexible machines are used in a wide range of applications, and they're pretty amazing. In this article, we'll chat about the features, benefits, and common uses of articulated robots, as well as some of the top manufacturers in the field. So, let's get started!

## What are Articulated Robots, Anyway?

Articulated robots are a type of industrial robot that's known for their jointed, interconnected arms. These robots usually have multiple degrees of freedom (DOF), which means they can perform complex tasks with high precision and repeatability. Plus, their flexible design allows them to work in tight spaces and around obstacles, making them perfect for all sorts of applications across numerous industries.

## The Awesome Features of Articulated Robots

- **Multiple degrees of freedom**: Articulated robots often have anywhere from 4 to 6 or even more DOF, letting them move in multiple directions and tackle intricate tasks.

- **High precision and repeatability**: Thanks to their jointed design, articulated robots can perform tasks with remarkable accuracy and consistency.

- **Flexible workspace**: Articulated robots can reach around obstacles and work in confined spaces, making them suitable for a wide range of environments.

- **High payload capacity**: Many articulated robots can handle heavy payloads, which means they can perform tasks that involve lifting or moving large objects.

## What Can Articulated Robots Do?

Articulated robots are used across a wide range of industries for various tasks, including:

- **Assembly**: Articulated robots are great at assembling parts and components with precision and speed.

- **Welding**: Robotic welding systems often rely on articulated robots for their flexibility and ability to reach different welding points.

- **Painting**: Articulated robots can perform precise, consistent paint applications, improving efficiency and reducing waste in the painting process.

- **Material handling**: Articulated robots are used for tasks like pick and place, palletizing, and packaging, where their high precision and repeatability are essential.

- **Machine tending**: Articulated robots can be used to load and unload parts from machines, reducing the need for manual labor and increasing productivity.
